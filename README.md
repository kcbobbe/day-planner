# Day Planner 
### Keep track of your work day with this daily planner.

## Description

This application is a daily planner that a user can use to keep track of appointments and events during the work day. The user can write an appointment or event for each hour, from 9 to 5. Their appointments and events for the day will be saved in their browser.

This web application was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Moment.js, the Numbers API and Bootstrap. The main goal of building this application was to build a single page web application that uses jQuery and JavaScript to dynamically render elements on a page. Moment.js is used to provide the current day and time on the page. The Numbers API is used to add a fun fact about the current day in history to the top of the page.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your computer
2. Open the project in a text editor of your choice
3. Open the index.html file in your browser to view

## Usage 
1. The day planner will show the current date and time. The row that is blue represents the current hour. Rows that are white represent future hours. Rows that are grey are past hours.
2. To add an event or appointment, click in the middle column and type your appointment in the textbox.
3. Click the 'save' button on the right to save your appointment.
4. Every day, your calendar will reset.

## Key Features
1. Moment.js is used to display the current time
2. Numbers API is used to display a random fact about the current day
3. Appointments and events saved by users are stored in the local storage, so the text will be saved even if the page is refreshed.
